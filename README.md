## My personality 

In general, I am an easy-going and out-going person.I am willing to start conversation and discussion with people around me. 
- SO, FEEL FREE TO TALK TO ME!!! 

Also, I attach great importance to responsibility and hard-work, which can be reflected on my punctuality and devotion to my study. I do know that I am not the so-called `talented ones`, but I believe hard-working matters more.

I am curious about anything as long as itâ€™s new to me, which motivates me to try and learn. Maybe this quote is too old and boring, however, it do works:
> Stay hungry, stay foolish.

### My expectation on this course

I know the importance of DATA and this new way of delivering messages and news to sudiences. And this is my first couse that involves DATA and story-telling. I want to learn the essential skills and form the habit of thinking of DATA, which can help me with my major courses in the following years of school.

#### Interested topics:
- mobile usage (using time or the purpose of using it.) 
- environmental issues 
- the time for TV updata cycle

To have a better learning experience, I expect your help.:grin: :heart:

So, how about this:kissing_heart: :
