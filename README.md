## My personality 

In general, I am an easy-going and out-going person.I am willing to start conversation and discussion with people around me. 

SO, FELL FREE TO TALK TO ME!!! 

Also, I attach great importance to responsibility and hard-work, which can be reflected on my punctuality and devotion to my study. I do know that I am not the so-called 'talented ones', but I believe hard-working matters more.

I am curious about anything as long as itâ€™s new to me. I am eager to learn and try.

So, how about this:kissing_heart:
